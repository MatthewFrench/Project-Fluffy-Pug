# Project-Fluffy-Pug
Project Fluffy Pug's goal is to farm and level by controlling League games through AI.

This is the Mac version. The Windows version is LeagueAutoPlay and isn't functional due to anti-cheat that is too good. It may be improved in tbe future. The Mac version is undetected. We're making a program that analyzes the screen to get information on League of Legends. It tracks text and health bars. It creates system events to control the game. The idea is to create an AI to either assist or play for the player.

It does not analyze memory or inject code, this is meant to be undetectable and indistinguishable by program or player.
