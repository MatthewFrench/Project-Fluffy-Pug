# Project-Fluffy-Pug
Project Fluffy Pug's goal is to farm and level by controlling League games through AI.

For the moment Mac only. We're making a program that analyzes the screen to get information on League of Legends. It tracks text and health bars. It creates system events to control the game. The idea is to create an AI to either assist or play for the player.

It does not analyze memory or inject code, this is meant to be undetectable and indistinguishable by program or player.
