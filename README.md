# Project-Fluffy-Pug
Project Fluffy Pug's goal is to create chaos in Riot by controlling League games through AI.

For the moment Mac only. We're making a program that analyzes the screen to get information on League of Legends. It tracks text and health bars. It creates system events to control the game. The idea is to create an AI to either assist or play for the player.
